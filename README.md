## Quick start

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/situhacks/agentframe-marketing.git
   cd agentframe-marketing
   ```

2. **Open the folder in your coding agent** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity, anything that respects `AGENTS.md`.

3. **Setup.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and drop in optional connector keys for Gemini and Composio (both have generous free tiers and are optional — the system still runs without them, you just lose Deep Research and direct publishing). If you plan to use Open Design locally, run `corepack pnpm install` inside `system/skills/open-design/source/`.

4. **Start your first campaign.** Tell the agent **"Start a new campaign"** and run it end-to-end.

### Mode swaps

AgentFrame ships with two `AGENTS.md` modes. You swap depending on what you're doing:

- **Swap to CMO when you're running a campaign** — drafting copy, generating images, publishing, doing a retro. CMO is scoped to `workspace/campaigns/` so it can't accidentally edit your templates or processes mid-campaign.
- **Swap to Builder when you're improving the system itself** — editing a template, adding a process, swapping a skill, applying retro patches. Builder is scoped to `system/` and `library/`.

You don't run shell commands by hand. Just tell the agent `swap to Builder` or `swap to CMO`. It handles the file swap and logs the transition to the audit DB.

### Updating your copy

This repo keeps evolving after you clone it. To pull updates into your customized copy, swap to Builder and tell the agent **"pull upstream updates"**. It fetches this repo, walks you through what changed commit by commit with a recommendation per change, re-applies your own template/process customizations on top where they collide, and asks before anything is written. Your personal layer — operator context, campaigns, backlog, audit history — is gitignored and never touched by a sync.

## Why this exists

I used to run my marketing campaigns out of Claude Chat. For a while I tried doing it all in chat sessions: write the post here, paste the voice rules there, ask for a rewrite, lose the thread, start over tomorrow. It works for something small, but for multi-post campaigns, things get lost and context starts to degrade. The voice rules I'd "saved" were forgotten by next session. State lived in scrollback. I spent more time retyping my instructions than I wanted.

I looked around for alternatives. What I found was prompt wrappers sitting on top of the same models I'm already paying for, and marketing repos with horrible token efficiency — one of them burned through my whole session before the first post was even done.

I didn't like what I saw. So I built my ideal system myself.

**AgentFrame Marketing** is a file-native marketing workspace that sits inside the coding agent I already use. Two `AGENTS.md` modes carry the work — **CMO** ships campaigns, **Builder** evolves the system. Campaign state lives in markdown files under `workspace/campaigns/`. Your voice, templates, and processes live in `library/`. Skills and connectors are swappable; when something sharper ships, I replace the skill and the system keeps working. See the [walkthrough below](#a-real-campaign-step-by-step) for what an end-to-end campaign actually looks like.

I've been dogfooding AgentFrame for a while and it's gone through multiple major revisions. The repo evolves with my workflow, not on a release schedule. It's free to fork — take what's useful.

It stands on excellent shoulders — Composio, Gemini Deep Research and image generation, Open Design, HyperFrames, the humanizer — wired up under [Recommended connectors](#recommended-connectors) and credited in [References and lineage](#references-and-lineage).

## A real campaign, step by step

A compact walkthrough using the example campaign at `workspace/campaigns/example-ai-automation-pov/`. One operator, six moves, no team handoffs.

## What makes it a harness

Three systems separate AgentFrame from a folder of prompt files.

### The deterministic spine

Models are strong writers and weak clerks — benchmarks have frontier models failing exact bookkeeping constraints 30–90% of the time, and my own agent skipped its lock procedure three times in one night. So campaign state transitions don't rely on the model remembering procedure: they run through `system/af.py`. Five buttons — `lock`, `publish`, `version`, `new-campaign`, `doctor` — each does its bookkeeping atomically (frontmatter, tracker, post assembly, activity trail) and prints back the judgment checklist the agent still owns: humanizer pass, voice check, reconciliation. `doctor` audits the books and never auto-fixes. It's plain stdlib Python, so the spine works identically in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or Antigravity; agent-native hooks stay optional seatbelts, never the foundation.

### A voice system that generates, not corrects

Most "brand voice" setups are a rules file the agent forgets by the third draft. AgentFrame compiles your actual writing into annotated contrastive pairs — generic version, your version, and the move that separates them — grouped by register. Drafting starts *from* the pairs: extract three or four concrete markers first, write the content pass, then a separate style pass with those markers mandated. Anti-patterns are weighted preferences with per-piece budgets (one contrastive negation per post, not zero) rather than flat bans that flatten the writing. A humanizer pass runs last, before anything locks.

### A learning loop with teeth

Every campaign closes with a harvest. Two skills read the version trails and your edit-diffs: one mines new voice pairs from what you actually changed, the other mines template and process patch candidates from how the work actually ran. You approve each patch, the library evolves, and the builder backlog plus audit DB keep the receipts. This isn't aspirational — every major feature in v1 traces back to a logged failure from a real campaign.

## At a glance



In the box: **12 deliverable templates**, **15 process files**, **16 skill bundles**, **3 campaign flows**, a two-mode persona model, a deterministic state-transition CLI, a local preview server, and a two-layer audit trail (`activity.md` + SQLite DB).

Everything in the library and skills layer is meant to be edited. Set voice and positioning once in `library/context/operator/` (copy from `operator.example/` on first run) and reuse them everywhere.



### Campaign flows

Add or edit any flow under `library/process/campaign-flows/` to match how you actually ship.

| Flow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `solo-flow` (default) | Lightweight campaign workflow for one operator moving fast |
| `open-flow` | Build-as-you-go — the agent proposes a plan scaled to the objective (phases, deliverables, runway); the operator narrows and sets the tempo |
| `standard-flow` | Heavier flow with broader deliverable coverage and more review gates — closer to an enterprise-style campaign |



### Deliverable templates

Edit, duplicate, or add new deliverable types under `library/deliverables/`.



| Template | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `business-brief` | Business context and objective framing |
| `research-artifact` | Research synthesis with sources and implications |
| `campaign-brief` | Campaign-level strategy and constraints |
| `campaign-architecture` | Post-by-post execution plan + the campaign's post manifest |
| `design-language` | Visual and style direction |
| `slide-copy` | Carousel slide-by-slide copy |
| `body-copy` | Platform caption that ships with the post |
| `post-final` | Per-post assembly record — locked ingredients + publish block |
| `image-prompts` | Per-post generation prompts — treatment block + per-slide deltas |
| `video-spec` | Video concept, scenes, and production plan |
| `campaign-retro` | Campaign-level learnings and improvements |
| `system-retro` | System-level process and architecture improvements |



### Process files

Process files load on demand — only when the workflow they describe is in play. They stay out of context until they're needed.



| Process | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `campaign-flow-authoring` | How to design or evolve campaign flows |
| `process-authoring` | How to design or evolve process files |
| `video-production` | Video workflow from spec to renders |
| `image-production` | Image generation workflow |
| `deck-production` | Deck/presentation path selection (PPTX skill, PPT Master, Open Design) |
| `preview-server` | When and how to use the local preview hub |
| `lock-event` | Lock trigger and judgment gates — mechanics run through the `af` CLI |
| `humanizer-integration` | Humanization pass integration |
| `campaign-frontmatter` | Frontmatter schema and state handling |
| `browser-fallback` | Browser automation fallback strategy |
| `composio-notes` | Connector usage notes and caveats |
| `voice-setup` | Build your voice system from your own writing (samples → interview → compiled profile + example pairs) |
| `voice-mini-retro` | Lock-time eligibility gate that routes your edit-diffs to the voice-harvest skill |
| `deliverable-versioning` | Surgical-vs-replacement judgment for `*-v{N}.md` deliverables — bumps run through `af version` |
| `research-and-signals` | Shared kickoff for campaign research: workspace-context definition, live MCP scan, research-method offer |



### Skills

My current production stack. Swap any of them for a sharper tool without touching templates or processes.

### Everything else that ships in the box

- Two-mode routing via `AGENTS.cmo.md` and `AGENTS.builder.md`
- A deterministic state-transition CLI at `system/af.py` — lock, publish, version, new-campaign, doctor. The buttons do the bookkeeping atomically and write the paper trail; the agent keeps the judgment. Models are strong writers and weak clerks, so the clerking is code.
- YAML frontmatter and campaign artifacts under `workspace/campaigns/`
- `activity.md` per campaign for human-readable history, plus an append-only SQLite audit DB at `system/audit/agentframe.db`
- Local preview server at `system/server/` for HTML, image, video, PDF, PPTX, and DOCX previews
- Browser harness at `system/browser/` using browser-use, with documented fallbacks when a workflow needs a hand-driven Chromium session

## Five architectural principles



### P1 — File-native state

Campaign state lives in markdown files: frontmatter, deliverables, `activity.md`. Not in a chat window. Change models, change machines, come back next week — the campaign picks up where it left off.

### P2 — Token efficiency at its core

`AGENTS.md` is the only always-on router; flows, processes, templates, and skills load on demand. Small focused context means longer sessions, fewer tokens per campaign, and less "agent forgets what we were doing" drift.

### P3 — The library is the product

Templates, processes, flows, and personas are the durable layer that improves over time. Skills and connectors are swappable — replace one when something sharper ships; the campaign system is untouched.

### P4 — Two modes, one operator

CMO ships campaigns. Builder evolves the system. The split means CMO can't accidentally edit `library/` mid-campaign, and Builder can't accidentally touch a locked deliverable mid-refactor.

### P5 — Buttons own mechanics, prose owns judgment

State changes run through the deterministic spine and write their own paper trail (`activity.md` per campaign, append-only SQLite for system events). The model never hand-edits campaign state; you can always reconstruct what happened and why.

## Recommended connectors



External services AgentFrame integrates with. Recommended for the full loop, but all optional — both Gemini and Composio have generous free tiers, and the system still runs campaigns without any of them. You just lose the automation each connector provides.

### Gemini Deep Research

- Deep research artifacts at campaign start — sources, implications, audience signals — saved as structured markdown under `phase-1-research/`.
- Free credits from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) cover solo-operator usage.
- Key: `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Gemini image generation (Nano Banana 2 / Pro)

- Fast A/B/C variants for standard illustrations (Nano Banana 2: `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`).
- High-fidelity hero and text-in-image visuals (Nano Banana Pro: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`).
- Routed through `system/server/lib/image_generate.py`; per-post prompt records save as `image-prompts-v{N}.md`.
- Shares the same `GEMINI_API_KEY` as Deep Research.

### Composio

- All-in-one MCP hub. One connection exposes 100+ tools (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) instead of installing a separate MCP server for each.
- Workplace signal collection (email, calendar, docs, notes) feeds campaign research and retros.
- Publishing — schedule or send directly to LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, and others.
- Analytics pullback to feed performance data into campaign retros.
- Get started at [composio.dev](https://composio.dev).

### Open Design

- Bundled local-first visual runtime at `system/skills/open-design/source/`.
- Used for higher-fidelity images, carousels, decks, and template-style visual work.
- Fresh clones may need runtime dependency setup (`corepack`, `pnpm install`, Node 24). Not a separate Open Design product install.
- Uses a local code-agent CLI on `PATH` (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.), or BYOK provider keys as a fallback.
- AgentFrame stages the handoff through the OD daemon API: campaign design system, selected OD mode/skill, project creation, and the first unsent prompt.
- Operator flow: open the prepared OD project, press Send, revise or export inside OD, then bring the locked asset back into the campaign.

### `.env` shape

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=
COMPOSIO_MCP_URL=https://connect.composio.dev/mcp
```

Your coding agent provides the LLM. These keys power the non-LLM tools (research generation, image generation, publishing).

Architecture summary:



- `AGENTS.md` is the only always-on router.

- Everything else is loaded on demand to preserve context efficiency.

- Campaign state and outputs live in files; system events are append-only in SQLite.

- State transitions (lock, publish, version, scaffold) run through `system/af.py` — deterministic mechanics and an automatic paper trail; the model never hand-edits campaign state.

## Preview server

<details>
<summary>Show preview server details</summary>

- Local preview hub at `system/server/`
- Previews HTML, images, video, PDF, PPTX, and DOCX
- Folder-tree navigation with hide rules to keep noise down
- Run with `py -3 system/server/run.py`

</details>

## Auditability and state

<details>
<summary>Show auditability details</summary>

- Campaign layer: `activity.md` in each campaign for the human-readable timeline — state transitions through `system/af.py` write it automatically.
- System layer: append-only SQLite audit DB at `system/audit/agentframe.db`.
- Writer: `system/audit/writer.py`.
- Books check: `python system/af.py doctor <campaign>` verifies schema, head pointers, and counters; it surfaces drift and never auto-fixes.
- Useful for reconstructing what happened, timing a phase, or tracing why a template changed.

</details>

## Roadmap



- [ ] Preview server v2: improved search, nested live reload, stronger video UX

- [ ] Additional campaign flows beyond solo/standard/open (newsletter, short-form video series, podcast launch)



## Status

The full loop runs today — kickoff, research, drafting, image/video production, publication, and retro all working end-to-end. I run real campaigns through it.
